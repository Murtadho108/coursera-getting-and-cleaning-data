# **Getting and Cleaning Data Project**
Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:
1. Download the zip file from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Unzip the file to the same directory, so we can get :
   * features.txt
   * subject_train.txt
   * X_train.txt
   * y_train.txt
   * subject_test.txt
   * X_test.txt
   * y_test.txt
4. After those steps complete, you can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](https://github.com/Murtadho108/coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data/blob/master/run_analysis.R))
The output of the R script is a tidy dataset, [tidy.txt](https://github.com/Murtadho108/coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data/blob/master/tidy.txt)
